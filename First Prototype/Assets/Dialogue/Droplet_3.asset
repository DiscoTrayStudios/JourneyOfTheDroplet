  dialogue:
  - Woah! You just eroded away that dirt!
  - Usually, that takes a long time.
  - Things like canyons, rivers, caves, and cliffs were all created from hundreds
    of years of erosion!
  - When there's a lot of wind and water that interacts with the earth, it wears
    away the land.
  - That's erosion, and you recreated it!
  - What you just did was amazing...
  - This water here leads above ground.
  - I think it used to fill this whole area...
  - I bet if you follow it, i bet you could make it out of this damp cave.
