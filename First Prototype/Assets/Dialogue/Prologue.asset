  - What makes a good story?
  - Is it the hero of the story?
  - Someone who fights tooth and nail to defeat evil and save the day?
  - Or is it the world created as each word from the page morphs and dances into
    beautiful landscapes in our mind's eye?
  - Who really knows for sure...
  - In the infinte library of stories, there are thousands of stories that follow
    these trends.
  - Enough stories to cover the sky with written words...
