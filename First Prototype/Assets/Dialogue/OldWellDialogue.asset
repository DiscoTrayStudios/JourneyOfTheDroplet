  dialogue:
  - Oh Goodness! You startled me!
  - I've never seen your face before little one, you must be new around here.
  - You must have come from the storm up there. I can tell by that sleepy look in
    your eye.
  - Many droplets have passed through here before, although I lost my water long
    ago...It's always nice to meet someone new!
  - Ah yes, I can see your surprise...
  - '''How could you lose your water'' you ask?'
  - I think there was a crack in my foundation, and over time little droplets like
    you make a big difference when you work together.
  - Water likes to seep into cracks and the like, and it can erode all sorts of stuff
    under the right circumstances!
  - 'If you want to know more, I''m sure you can hop on in and find someone to tell
    you all about it!
