  dialogue:
  - Oh Goodness! You startled me!
  - I've never seen your face before little one, you must be new around here.
  - You must have come from the storm up there. I can tell by that sleepy look in
    your eye.
  - Well don't worry about a thing. Just try your best to move about and get your
    bearings.
  - You'll figure out you're way in no time!
