  - When condensation in the clouds get heavier, that condensation forms water droplets.
  - Furthermore, when those droplets get too heavy, those droplets fall to the ground
    as rain.
  - Well, allow me to tell you a story about that rain.
  - A very special story some might say...
  - A story about more than just water, or the planet.
  - No, its something more unique than that...
  - This is a story of strength.
  - A story of self-acceptance in a world that's ever changing.
  - This is the story of one young adventurer, and their journey to learn where they
    belong.
  - This is the Journey of the Droplet.
